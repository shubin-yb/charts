# This is the result of the merge.
# To successfully merge, we need to follow rules for merging nodeSelectorTerms that kubernentes has.
# Each new node selector term is ORed together, and each match expression or match field in a single
# selector is ANDed together. 
# This means, if a pod needs to be scheduled on a label 'custom_label_1' with a value 
# 'custom_value_1', we need to add this 'subterm' to each of our pre-defined node affinity
# terms.
#
# Pod anti affinity is a simpler merge. Each term is applied separately, and the weight is tracked.
# The pod that achieves the highest weight is selected.
